const data = `<p>What is an appeal? An appeal is <em>not</em> a new trial, but rather an opportunity where the facts and evidence in a case can be argued again, perhaps this time with a different outcome. If a trial lawyer&rsquo;s job is to present and convince juries the facts of a case, then an appellate lawyer&rsquo;s job is to <a href="http://www.natlawreview.com/article/why-do-we-have-appellate-lawyers">persuade</a> and argue the law to judges. Doing that requires a deep understanding of the law and the ability to explain it well.</p>
<p>If we win your case and it is later threatened by an appeal, we are prepared to fight for you in that next step. Both crafting a successful appeal and defending one takes excellent research and writing skills, as well as the experience to spot key issues in a case that could affect the outcome of the appeal.
